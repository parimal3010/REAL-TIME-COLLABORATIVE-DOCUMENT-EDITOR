*This application is a web‑based document editor that enables multiple users to collaborate on the same document in real time. Built with a modern JavaScript stack, it provides a Google‑Docs–style experience: as one user types or formats text, every other participant sees those changes instantly.

Key Features

Real‑Time Synchronization: Leveraging Socket.IO, user edits are broadcast to all connected clients within milliseconds, ensuring everyone sees the latest content without manual refresh.

Rich Text Editing: The frontend uses Quill.js to offer formatting options (bold, italics, lists, headings, etc.), so users can create styled documents, not just plain text.*
